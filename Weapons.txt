
Sword
    It's like a stick, but sharp! Maybe be carefull with this...
Axe
    A bit heavy, but it should do some damage.
Spear
    It's long and pointy, should come in handy!
Hammer
    I don't see any nails around here... Do you?
Dagger
    So you prefer close combat?
Mace
    You should be able to smash some skulls with this thing!
Extra hard stick
    It's a stick! But *extra* hard
Throwing knives
    Despite the name, you do not actually need to throw them. (cool right?)
