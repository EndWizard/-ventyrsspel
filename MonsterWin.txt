The slime charges towards you, and attempts to attatch to your leg.
However, with your reaction time you swiftly slash it in the air.
The slime pieces fall on the floor and makes a slimy puddle.

The dragon is standing guard outside the door, it's huge.
You're trying to figure out the best attack plan, but the dragon already spotted you.
You charge the dragon, dodging any fire balls flying your way.
When you finnaly reach the dragon you thrust your weapon towards it.
You manage to lodge your weapon inbetween the dragons scales.
The dragon lets out a roar, and moves its head to bite you.
The head is aproaching, and you deal your final blow towards the dragons throat.

The demon approaches you, and requests that you play a game of dice.
After close consideration, you decide you better not.
you swiftly slay the demon, whose death results in a strange fire and some other theatrics.
It's proabably better this way.
I mean, it's not like you knew how to play dice anyways.
